    "## **Introduction to Tokenizers**\n",
    "\n",
    "### **What are Tokenizers?**\n",
    "At its core, a large language model (LLM) or any deep learning model understands numbers, not raw text. Tokenizers bridge this gap, converting human-readable text into a numerical format that models can process.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **The Problem with Traditional Word-based Tokenizers**\n",
    "1. **Vocabulary Size:** If we tried to make every unique word in the world a separate entry in a model's vocabulary, the vocabulary would be enormous (millions of words), making models inefficient and difficult to train.\n",
    "2. **Out-Of-Vocabulary (OOV) Words:** What happens when the model encounters a word it has never seen during training? Traditional word-based tokenizers would map this to an \"unknown\" token, losing all semantic information.\n",
    "3. **Morphology:** Words often share common roots or prefixes/suffixes (e.g., \"running,\" \"runs,\" \"ran\"). Word-level tokenization treats these as completely distinct, losing potential linguistic connections.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **The Solution - Subword Tokenization**\n",
    "Modern tokenizers, especially with Transformer models, use subword tokenization. Instead of splitting text into full words, they break it down into smaller, meaningful units (subwords) that can be combined to form words. This offers a fantastic balance:\n",
    "1. Smaller Vocabulary: Fewer unique subwords than unique words.\n",
    "2. Handles OOV: Any new word can be broken down into known subwords (e.g., \"unpredictable\" could become \"un\" + \"predict\" + \"able\").\n",
    "3. Morphological Information: Related words share common subwords.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Common Tokenization Algorithms**\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's look at the most common subword algorithms:\n",
    "| Algorithm | Description | Example |\n",
    "| ------ | ------ | ------ |\n",
    "| **BPE (Byte Pair Encoding)** | Breaks rare words into common subwords | `huggingface → hug + ging + face` |\n",
    "| **WordPiece** | Used in BERT; similar to BPE, adds special prefix (`##`) for subwords | `loving → lov + ##ing` |\n",
    "| **SentencePiece** | Used in T5, ALBERT; language-agnostic, treats everything as a sequence of bytes | `▁I ▁love ▁AI` |\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Special Tokens**\n",
    "\n",
    "Tokenizers also introduce special tokens that models use for specific purposes:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. `[CLS]` / `<s>` (Classification/Start): Often used at the beginning of a sequence. For classification tasks, the hidden state corresponding to this token is often used as the aggregated representation of the entire sequence.\n",
    "2. `[SEP]` / `</s>` (Separator/End): Used to separate two sequences (e.g., in question answering, where you have a question and a context) or to mark the end of a single sequence.\n",
    "3. `[PAD]` / `<pad>` (Padding): Used to fill shorter sequences to the same length as the longest sequence in a batch (more on this later).\n",
    "4. `[UNK]` / `<unk>` (Unknown): A fallback token for characters or subwords not found in the vocabulary (rare with subword tokenization, but possible).\n",
    "5. `[MASK]` / `<mask>` (Mask): Used in masked language modeling (e.g., BERT) where a token is randomly masked, and the model has to predict it."

    "## **Introduction to Auto Classes**\n",

    "### **Loading Models & Tokenizers Manually**\n",
    "While **pipeline** is great for quick tasks, for more control (e.g., when you want to fine-tune a model, access intermediate layers, or customize generation parameters), you'll load the **model** and its corresponding **tokenizer** separately. This is where the **Auto classes** come in.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Why is it called \"auto\"?**\n",
    "It's **\"auto\"** because it intelligently loads the correct tokenizer architecture and configuration for any pre-trained model you specify, ensuring compatibility.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Why use Auto classes?**\n",
    "1. **Simplicity:** You don't need to know the exact class name (e.g., BertTokenizer, GPT2Model). Auto handles it.\n",
    "2. **Interoperability:** Easily swap models by just changing the model_name string.\n",
    "3. **Compatibility:** Ensures that the tokenizer and model are correctly matched for a given pre-trained checkpoint.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Setting up a custom pipeline using Auto Classes**\n",

    "2. Use the AutoModel to solve the Task (i.e. Pass the input to appropriate Model)\n",

    "### **Preprocessing Data using `AutoTokenizer` (i.e. Tokenize the input)**\n",
    "\n",
    "The main purpose of **AutoTokenizer** is to convert raw text into numerical representations (tokens) that a model can understand. This is achieved by:\n",
    "1. **Splitting text:** Breaking down text into words or sub-word units.\n",
    "2. **Converting to IDs:** Mapping those units to numerical IDs from the model's vocabulary.\n",
    "3. **Adding special tokens:** Adding tokens like [CLS] (start of sequence) or [SEP] (separator) required by certain models.\n",
    "4. **Padding and Truncation:** Making all input sequences the same length (padding) or cutting them down (truncation) to fit the model's maximum input size.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before you can train a model on a dataset, it needs to be preprocessed into the expected model input format. Whether your data is text, images, or audio, they need to be converted and assembled into batches of tensors. 🤗 Transformers provides a set of preprocessing classes to help prepare your data for the model. Note that:\n",
    "- **AutoTokenizer:** Text, use a `AutoTokenizer` to convert text into a sequence of tokens, create a numerical representation of the tokens, and assemble them into tensors.\n",
    "- **AutoFeatureExtractor:** Speech and audio, use a `AutoFeatureExtractor` to extract sequential features from audio waveforms and convert them into tensors.\n",
    "- **AutoImageProcessor:** Image inputs use a `AutoImageProcessor` to convert images into tensors.\n",
    "- **AutoProcessor:** Multimodal inputs, use a `AutoProcessor` to combine a tokenizer and a feature extractor or image processor.\n",

    "\n",
    "- **tokenizer.model_max_length:** The maximum length (in number of tokens) that the associated model is designed to handle. When loading a tokenizer with from_pretrained(), this value is often set based on the max_position_embeddings in the model's configuration. If no specific value is found, it might default to a very large integer (e.g., 1e30), indicating the tokenizer itself doesn't impose a hard limit, but the model still will.\n",
    "- **tokenizer.vocab_size:** The total number of unique tokens in the tokenizer's vocabulary. This includes all the subword tokens and any special tokens.\n",
    "- **tokenizer.is_fast:** A boolean indicating if this is a Rust-backed \"Fast\" tokenizer (which are generally recommended for speed and extra features like offset mapping).\n",
    "- **tokenizer.padding_side:** Indicates whether padding should be applied to the 'right' (default for most encoder models like BERT) or 'left' (common for decoder models like GPT-2, where the model generates token by token from left to right).\n",
    "- **tokenizer.truncation_side:** Indicates whether truncation should happen from the 'right' (default, cutting off the end) or 'left' (cutting off the beginning).\n",
    "- **tokenizer.model_input_names:** A list of the expected input names for the model's forward pass (e.g., ['input_ids', 'attention_mask', 'token_type_ids']). This is useful for understanding what keys the tokenizer() method will return.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Special Token Properties (and their IDs):**\n",
    "- Tokenizers automatically add special tokens (like [CLS], [SEP], [PAD]) during tokenization. These properties store the string representation of these tokens and their corresponding numerical IDs in the vocabulary.\n",
    "- **tokenizer.unk_token** and **tokenizer.unk_token_id:** Unknown token (for OOV words).\n",
    "- **tokenizer.pad_token** and **tokenizer.pad_token_id:** Padding token.\n",
    "- **tokenizer.cls_token** and **tokenizer.cls_token_id:** Classification token (e.g., BERT's start token).\n",
    "- **tokenizer.sep_token** and **tokenizer.sep_token_id:** Separator token.\n",
    "- **tokenizer.mask_token** and **tokenizer.mask_token_id:** Mask token (for masked language modeling).\n",
    "- **tokenizer.bos_token** and **tokenizer.bos_token_id:** Beginning of sentence token.\n",
    "- **tokenizer.eos_token** and **tokenizer.eos_token_id:** End of sentence token.\n",

    "    - Efficiency: GPUs perform parallel computations very well. Processing multiple samples at once keeps the GPU busy and utilizes its power effectively.\n",
    "    - Speed: Reduces overhead from repeatedly transferring data between CPU and GPU.\n",
    "- Batched inputs are often different lengths, so they can’t be converted to fixed-size tensors. **Padding and truncation are strategies for** dealing with this problem, to create rectangular tensors from batches of varying lengths. Padding adds a **special padding token** to ensure shorter sequences will have the same length as either the longest sequence in a batch or the maximum length accepted by the model. Truncation works in the other direction by **truncating long sequences**."

    "    - If a sequence is shorter than the max_length value, the tokenizer will add [PAD] tokens to the end of that sequence until it reaches the specified max_length.\n",

    "- truncation=True + max_length specified:\n",
    "    - If a sequence is longer than the max_length value, the tokenizer will cut off (truncate) the excess tokens from the end of that sequence until it fits the specified max_length.\n",
    "    - This is essential because models have an inherent maximum context window or max_position_embeddings (e.g., 512 for bert-base-uncased). Passing a sequence longer than this limit would result in an error or undefined behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "In most cases, padding your batch to the length of the longest sequence, and truncating to the maximum length a model can accept, works pretty well. However, the API supports more strategies if you need them. The three arguments you need to are: `padding`, `truncation` and `max_length`.\n"
