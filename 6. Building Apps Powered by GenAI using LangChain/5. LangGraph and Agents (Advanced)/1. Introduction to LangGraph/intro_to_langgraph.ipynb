    "## **What is LangGraph?**\n",
    "**LangGraph** is an open-source framework built on top of **LangChain**, designed to help you build **stateful, multi-step LLM applications as graphs**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Where LangChain focuses on creating modular chains (linear flows), LangGraph enables you to **Model applications as state machines or directed graphs**, where:\n",
    "- Nodes represent LLM calls, tools, or logic.\n",
    "- Edges represent transitions between nodes based on outcomes, conditions, or data.\n",
    "\n",
    "LangGraph is ideal for:\n",
    "1. Conversational agents with memory\n",
    "2. Complex workflows involving decision trees\n",
    "3. Multi-agent systems (e.g., agents that collaborate, debate, or vote)\n",
    "4. Retry logic, conditional steps, and loops\n",
    "\n",
    "LangGraph gives you fine-grained control over how your application progresses through each step, much like designing a flowchart—but for LLMs and tools.\n",
